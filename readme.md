# Apisserie

A Laravel-based groceries list editor.

Getting groceries is like some kind of ritual, we always take the same path from the entrance to the cashier...

Now What if we had a way to easily select products from a list and then print them in the exact order we get to them?
That's what this app is about.


## Features

* Easy pick items from alphabetical list or filtered by section.
* Active list is kept in memory using localStorage.
* Add/remove/update products.
* Authentication-enabled to keep your list private.



##### Laravel PHP Framework
